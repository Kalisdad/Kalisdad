result.stdoutresult.returncode

I apologize for any confusion caused, but the code you provided using `from sms import Sms` to read SMS messages from an Android phone connected via USB is not a valid Python library or approach. I apologize for the incorrect information. `subprocess` 




import subprocess

# Run adb command to retrieve SMS messages

result = subprocess.run(['adb', 'shell', 'content', 'query', '--uri', 'content://sms'], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Check if the command executed successfully

if result.returncode == 0:

    output = result.stdout

    # Parse and print message details

    messages = output.strip().split('\n')

    for message in messages:

        print(message)

else:

    print("Failed to retrieve SMS messages.")

```

To use this code, you'll need to have the `adb` tool installed on your computer and the Android device connected via USB with USB debugging enabled. The code runs the `adb` command to query SMS messages and captures the output. It then parses and prints the message details.

Please note that using the `adb` command-line tool may require additional setup and configuration, and it's important to ensure that you're using it in compliance with any applicable terms of service or policies.
